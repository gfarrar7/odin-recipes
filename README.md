# odin-recipes
My first HTML project - TOP Recipe Website

This is my first project with TOP (The Odin Project).
It is to test the skills that I have recently learnt in this course. I will be using skills such as git commands, file creation and modication commands, boilerplate creation and image and link incorporation.
