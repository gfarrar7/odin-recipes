        <section class="index introduction">
        <p>In 2018, the United Nations identified animal agriculture and meat production as the most urgent problem around the world – a catastrophe of our own making. Going a step further, the United Nations Environment Programme recognized vegan companies like <a href="beyondmeat.com/en-US/">Beyond Meat</a> and <a href= "https://impossiblefoods.com/">Impossible Foods</a> as <strong>“Champions of the Earth”</strong>; more environmentally-friendly options that could be able to fully substitute the demand for meat in the future. Whilst full veganism may be daunting for most, even a small reduction in animal product consumption, such as vegetarian, pescatarian, or flexitarian diets, can help promote a greener future.</p>
        <p>It is important to note that reducing your animal product consumption does not mean you must go without, and this is showcased in the following 3 recipes, which highlight the types of delicious feasts you can still enjoy whilst adopting a more plant-based diet. <strong><em>Enjoy!</em></strong></p>
